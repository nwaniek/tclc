tclc - tiny OpenCL compiler

tclc compiles OpenCL kernel files in order to help finding static problems at compile
time rather than application run time.



0 Requirements

To build tclc you need the OpenCL header and libOpenCL.



1 Compilation

In order to compile tclc, you have to alter the Makefile to have it point to
proper include and library folders for the OpenCL header and lib. When done,
type make.
At the moment, compilation is only tested against the AMD Stream SDK



2 Installation

There's no installation routine incorporated yet, you have to manually move the
binary to its destined location.



3 Usage

tclc [options] filename...
Options:
  -d <arg>     Specify the device type. arg is either CPU or GPU. default is GPU
  -l           List all available platforms, devices and device types
  -v           Print version information
  - h --help   Show the help message

You can specify more than one cl file. The files will be compiled subsequently.
Any compilation error will stop tclc and it will print the corresponding error
information produced by OpenCL to stdout!  Every build log information is
preceded with a "Build Log for <filename>:" line, because OpenCL might use
temporary files and not tell you the correct file name in the Build Log

If there are no problems, tclc will return with status EXIT_SUCCESS without any
additional output.



4 Misc

Behaviour and TODOs:
  * tclc takes the first platform it finds to create a context
  * it is not possible to pass build parameters through to opencl (this will be
    fixed in a later release
  * with multiple devices of different types, tclc warns that build log is not
    available for a device that has not the specified device type...
  * only one device type per call
  * output is somewhat ugly



5 License

See LICENSE file for more details



6 Fixes
  * when passed multiple target files, tclc tries to compile each file,
    regardless if one of the other files failed.
